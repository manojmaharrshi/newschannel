<p>"Here" is the debut single by Canadian singer Alessia Cara. <br>
It is the lead single for her extended play (EP) Four Pink Walls (2015) and her debut album Know-It-All (2015).<br>
 The song was released on April 30, 2015.<br>
 Created around a sample of "Ike's Rap II" by Isaac Hayes from the album Black Moses, "Here" is about people who secretly hate parties.<br>
 The song slowly gained popularity, and became Cara's first US Billboard Hot 100 chart entry debuting at number 95 for the week of August 22, 2015.<br>
It later became her first top five single on the chart and reached the top of the US Pop Songs chart after a historic 26-week climb. <br>
"Here" has charted in the top 40 in Australia, Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.<br>
 The official remix features American rapper Logic. <br>
The song was featured on the third season of the comedy-drama television series Younger.<br>
